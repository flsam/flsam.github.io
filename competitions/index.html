				<h3>ARML</h3>
				<a href = "http://arml2.com/arml_2018/page/" target="_blank">ARML website</a><br>
				The American Regions Mathematics League is a national competition held simultaneously at four centers across the country. Teams are organized geographically. Each state typically has their own representative team(s), joined by some large cities, schools, and urban areas. FLSAM (Florida) sends up to three teams every year. Competitors embark on an epic, four day road trip from southern Florida to the University of Alabama, Huntsville (formerly University of Georgia, Atlanta) and through the rural backcountry in between. A single bus starts in Miami and journeys across Florida to slowly collect passengers along the way, quite similarly to <i>The Muppet Movie</i>, for an adventurous trip to new places.
