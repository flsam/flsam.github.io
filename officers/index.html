            <p>
              My name is Rui Jiang and I’m a senior at Pine View School. I have been doing math competitions since I started taking the AMC 8 in 6 th grade. Since then, I have participated in other math competitions such as USAJMO, Mathcounts, ARML, PUMAC, HMMT, SMT, and CMIMC. Outside of math, I like to play chess, tennis, and video games.

            <p>
              Luis Fonseca is a junior at Doral Academy High School. He has been competing since 6th grade in math competitions, but joined FLSAM and started taking competitions more seriously in 8th/9th, and has competed in FAMAT, Mathcounts, AMC series, CMIMC, SMT and more. His favorite type of math is number theory and he dislikes most geometry and he enjoys writing problems. Outside of math, he may be found loudly insulting his friends, napping, procrastinating homework, listening to objectively good music, (fake!) gambling, and with his greatest accomplishment (his own words) his girlfriend.

He is passionate about learning new topics in math, as well as competing with his friends in competitions such as SMT online, Purple Comet, and the incredibly illustrious Cowconuts Math Meet. His favorite topic in math is geometry, with the glaring exception of angle chasing. In his free time, Joey likes going to the gym, listening to music, and SCUBA diving whenever he can.
