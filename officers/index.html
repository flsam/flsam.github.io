					<h3 class="prof-header">Matt Ryan: <br> Region 2 Coordinator</h3>
					<img class="prof-img" src="FLSAM_1718_ryan.png"></img>
					<p>
						Matt Ryan is a senior at Gainesville High School (yes, the school other than Buchholz in Gainesville) and is the Vice President of his school's Mu Alpha Theta chapter. He has been fond of math for as long as he can remember and also loves physics and chemistry. He began competing in 9th grade in FAMAT and later FLSAM-sponsored competitions and is thankful for the great friends he has made through mathematics.

					<h3 class="prof-header">Sam Li: <br> Region 3 Coordinator</h3>
					<img class="prof-img" src="FLSAM_1718_sli.png"></img>
					<p>
						Samuel Li is a senior at Seminole High. He doesn't actually know any math, but has pretended to his whole life and so far nobody has noticed. He is glucose-intolerant and can't cook without increasing the entropy of his food. Despite his possible shortcomings, he has been involved with FLSAM throughout his otherwise uneventful high school life. He can work astoundingly efficiently, as evidenced by his ability to complete a six-month project the night before. He enjoys using the USAMO as an excuse to take a nap during school and will do his best to spread word about this opportunity to prospective new FLSAM members.

					<h3 class="prof-header">Harrison Yang: Region 4a Coordinator</h3>
					<img class="prof-img" src="FLSAM_1718_yang.png"></img>
					<p>
						Harrison Yang is a senior at King High School, where he is president of the Mu Alpha Theta chapter there. He was lightly introduced to contest math in middle school through MathCounts, but really discovered Florida's math circle through the FLSAM coordinator's recommendation when he was a high school freshman. He took the AMCs, and at his first ARML, he was awestruck by not only the mass concentration of respectable intellect but also the powerful bonds he formed with those similar in mindset to him. He hopes that he'll be able to offer other budding mathematicians the same opportunities that he himself was given, and that in this way he'll be able to have some lasting impact on the Florida math circle. While not doing math, Harrison can usually be found spending time with friends, doing SGA things, playing piano, in the gym, throwing frisbees at Richard, and/or respecting women.

						Daniel Sarnecki is a senior at American Heritage - Plantation.  He began competing in FAMAT competitions in 9th grade, when he took a keen interest in geometry problems.  Since then, Daniel has explored other areas of math and joined FLSAM, which has allowed him to meet many motivated people and compete in competitions such as HMMT, CMIMC, and ARML.  These experiences have inspired him to share his knowledge of math with the up-and-coming geometers at his school.  When he isn't solving tough integrals, he enjoys golfing, playing piano, and jogging.

					<img class="prof-img" src="FLSAM_1718_fernandez.png"></img>
					<p>
						Amanda Fernandez is a senior at Doral Academy High School, where she is Vice President of her school's Mu Alpha Theta chapter.  She joined FLSAM after hearing about it at the 2016 Essner Competition at University of Miami and she is eternally grateful that she joined.  Her first competition with FLSAM was ARML, where she fell even more in love with the FLSAM community.  Amanda loves all things math, but especially enjoys topology and graph theory. When she is not doing math, she is probably coding or listening to country music or doing both simultaneously.

						William (Bill) Li is a sophomore at King High School. He began competing in Mathcounts in sixth grade... at the school level. Two years later, he was invited to join FLSAM. Since then, he has participated in many math competitions in and out of FLSAM, including ARML, FAMAT, and USAJMO. He loves FLSAM and the opportunities such a club offers. Bill enjoys all of math (except maybe functional equations) but finds geometry unique in its beauty. Besides doing math, he spends his time swimming, playing cello, and losing at chess. Bill is looking forward to participating and helping in future FLSAM activities and competitions.

					<h3 class="prof-header">Saaketh Vedantam: Curriculum Committee</h3>
					<img class="prof-img" src="FLSAM_1718_vedantam.png"></img>
					<p>
						Saaketh Vedantam is a junior at American Heritage School and an avid mathlete. He has been a part of FLSAM since 9th grade, but mathematics has been a part of his life since the womb. Apart from math, Saaketh enjoys physics and computer science. However, when he isn't trying to decipher a random USAMO proof or wondering why a code won't compile, he plays video games and watches movies, a fact which has gotten him in trouble with his parents more than once.

					<h3 class="prof-header">Vayun Alapati: 
							<br>Curriculum Committee</h3>
					<img class="prof-img" src="FLSAM_1718_alapati.png"></img>
					<p>
						Vayun Alapati is currently a senior at Marjorie Stoneman Douglas. Not surprisingly, his favorite subject is mathematics, although what others may not know is his additional passion for curriculum coordination as an officer of FLSAM. He has been involved in a number of math competitions, from FAMAT to AMC to ARML, all contests he has taken a great deal of experience from and had very fond memories of. When he isn't busy solving AIME problems or figuring out when the next contest he can participate in will be, some may find him either playing the piano, volunteering at the Veteran's Affairs Organization, or counting the number of AP classes he'll be taking next year. FLSAM has provided Vayun one of the best math communities and friends he could hope to find in Florida and he hopes to serve as an officer to the best of his ability for the upcoming year.

					<h3 class="prof-header">Yuru Niu: 
							<br>Curriculum Committee</h3>
					<img class="prof-img" src="FLSAM_1718_niu.JPG"></img>
					<p>
						Yuru is a sophomore at Suncoast High School. He started doing math competitions in 4th grade starting with Algebra 1 FAMAT and AMC 8. Then after he got interested in that, he continued doing math competitions until he discovered FLSAM in 8th grade and got exposure to even more(and better) math competitions like HMMT, PUMaC, and ARML. He likes parts of all 4 branches of math, but his favorites are coordinate bashing and expected value. He has taken interest in creating problems after reading about barycentric coordinates and because he wants to give them to his friends. In addition to math, Yuru enjoys playing the piano, listening to music, surfing the web, and looking at memes.
